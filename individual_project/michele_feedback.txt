Good job with the app. I think however that your alarm always goes off, no matter what time you put. There’s probably a bug somewhere in your timer that checks whether the sound is supposed to play that is always true. If you send me screenshots of your blocks editor I will look at it and tell you where the bug is. 

My main comment about the app is that the user interface doesn’t really tell me what is going to happen. It is clear that I am supposed to enter a time (that part is done well), but it is unclear what I am supposed to take a picture of when the camera pops up. It would be helpful to have “helper text” somewhere in or around the app to tell me what I am supposed to do or what I should anticipate doing in the app. 

Good job in working through the documentation and all of the bugs that came along with the hardware.
